<P>Object-role Modeling (ORM) is a fact-oriented modeling approach for specifying, transforming, and querying information at a conceptual level. Unlike Entity-Relationship modeling and Unified Modeling Language class diagrams, fact-oriented modeling is attribute-free, treating all elementary facts as relationships. For information modeling, fact-oriented graphical notations are typically far more expressive than other notations. Introduced 30 years ago, ORM has evolved into closely related dialects, and is supported by industrial and academic tools. Industrial experience has identified ways to improve cur-rent ORM languages (graphical and textual) and associated tools. A project is now under way to provide tool support for a second generation ORM (called ORM 2), that has significant advances over current ORM technology. This paper provides an overview of, and motivation for, the enhancements introduced by ORM 2, and discusses an open-source ORM 2 tool under development.

<P>This white paper provides an overview of Object Role Modeling (ORM), 
      using a case study to illustrate the main ideas. The steps used to design 
      a conceptual schema for an information system are first explained in some 
      detail. To help communicate the ideas, some mistakes are deliberately 
      made. Checking procedures within the design method are later used to 
      remove these errors. A simple example is included to show how the 
      conceptual design may be "optimized" for relational database systems by 
      applying a transformation. An algorithm for mapping this design to a 
      normalized, relational database schema is then outlined. Finally, the 
      paper gives a brief sketch of how ORM can be used as a sound basis for 
      conceptual queries, object oriented modeling, and process/event modeling.

      <P>Object Role Modeling (ORM) is a method for modeling and querying an 
      information system at the conceptual level, and mapping between conceptual 
      and logical (e.g. relational) levels. ORM comes in various flavors, 
      including NIAM (Natural language Information Analysis Method). This 
      article provides an overview of ORM, and notes its advantages over entity 
      relationship and traditional object oriented modeling. <BR>This paper and 
      the Object Role Modeling Overview paper overlap substantially; however, 
      the historical details, symbol summary, and references provide additional 
      material.

      <P>This article provides a gentle introduction to Object Role Modeling 
      (ORM), explaining its advantages over entity relationship and object 
      oriented approaches for capturing and validating business rules with 
      subject matter experts. The ORM attribute-free, mixfix predicate approach 
      simplifies verbalization, multiple instantiation and schema evolution, and 
      its rich constraint language enables many rules to be captured graphically 
      and easily validated. The article includes simple examples to illustrate 
      these advantages.
