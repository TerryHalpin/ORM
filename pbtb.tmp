      vspace=5 align=right src="images/home_pic.png" width=357 height=200 ><b>Object Role Modeling (ORM)</b> is a 
      powerful method for designing and querying database models at the 
      conceptual level, where the application is described in terms easily 
      understood by non-technical users. In practice, ORM data models often 
      capture more business rules, and are easier to validate and evolve than 
      data models in other approaches. 
      <p>This site features a number of technical papers and articles on ORM, as 
      well as other approaches such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

<p>The submission deadlines have been extended for the 8th International Workshop on Fact-Oriented Modeling (<b>ORM2012</b>) to be held September 12-14, 2012 in Rome in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.onthemove-conferences.org/">On The Move Conferences</a>. Abstracts are due May 31 and full papers on June 4. The <b>Final Call For Papers</b> for ORM2012 may be found <a href = "pdf/ORM_2012_CFP3.pdf" target=_blank>here</a>. 

<p>Dr Halpin gave a keynote presentation titled 'Fact-Orientation and Conceptual Logic' at the EDOC2011 Conference in Helsinki on September 1, 2011. A video of the presentation is accessible from a link on the Resouces page.      

<p>Links to articles 8, 9 and 10 (and previous articles) of Dr Halpin's series on ontology modeling for the <i>Business Rules Journal</i> are now on the Resources page. 

<p> An updated, 6-page summary of the ORM 2 Graphical notation, including examples, is available for download on the Resources page.</p>

<p>The Exploring Modeling Methods in Systems Analysis and Design (EMMSAD) series of annual conferences provide a forum to discuss the latest advances in information systems modeling. The <b>EMMSAD2012/EuroSymposium2012 Conference</b> will be held June 25-26, 2012 in Gdansk, Poland in conjunction with CAiSE 2012.

    <td>The <b>2nd edition</b> of <i><b>Information Modeling and Relational Databases</b></i> (ISBN:  978-0-12-373568-3) was published on March 1, 2008. This major upgrade of the earlier edition runs to 970 pages and includes loads of new and updated content. Fully updated to ORM 2 and UML 2 and the latest developments in SQL and XML, this book reveals the true power of semantic data modeling (covering ORM, ER, and UML), as well as addressing business process modeling, relational databases, and other modeling topics such as the semantic web. Here is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Modeling-Relational-Databases-Second/dp/0123735688/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1202166747&amp;sr=1-5"

<p><b>NORMA</b> (Natural ORM Architect) is a new modeling tool under 
      development that supports the next generation of ORM (ORM 2). Implemented 
      as an open-source plug-in to Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET, NORMA 
      requires at least the standard version of Visual Studio (2005 or 2008). For further 
      details on the ORM 2 graphical notation, see <a 
      href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport1.pdf" target=_blank>ORM 2 Technical Report 
      1</a>. A technical preview of NORMA is available on <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/Default.aspx">The ORM Foundation</a> as well as SourceForge. Here is an <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/files/">ORM Foundation link to NORMA</a>, and here is a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/orm" target="_top">SourceForge link to NORMA</a>. 
<br>The NORMA software is currently in the pre-beta stage, but extensive functionality enhancements and 
      user-interface improvements are planned for the near future. Currently the 
      tool supports entry of ORM2 schemas, verbalization of of most constraints, 
      and code generation (for basic constraints) to a variety of DBMSs 
      (including SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL) as well as class 
      models and XML schema. NORMA is capable of importing ORM schemas entered 
      in Visio for Enterpise Architects, but the diagrams need to be laid out 
      manually.  For Part 1 of the specification for automated verbalization in NORMA, see  <a 
      href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport2.pdf" target=_blank>ORM 2 Technical Report 2</a>.
