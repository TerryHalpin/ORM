<p><i>Last updated: 2003 August 10:</i>

<br><P><hr><b>What's new?</b>

<p>Updated Northface University links (this page), conference details and book errata (Resources page).
<br>Added resource description and link to the <a href = "http://www.brcommunity.com/index.shtml">Business Rules Community</a>, which publishes the <i>Business Rules Journal</i> (Resources page). This journal includes a column by Terry Halpin -- the current focus of this column is on business rule verbalization.
<br>Added details on upcoming conferences: <a href="http://www.er.byu.edu/er2003/">ER2003</a>, <a href = "http://www.er.byu.edu/er2003/er2003cfindustry.html">ER2003 Industrial Track</a> (see Resources page).
<br>Added Part 8 of series on using Visio for Enterprise Architects (see Resources page).


<p>The <a href = "http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/">25th episode of the .NET Show</a> focused on ORM, including an interview with Terry Halpin, Pat Hallock and Dick Barden, and demonstrations of the ORM and database modeling features of Microsoft Visio for Enterprise Architects.

<p><b>Software releases</b>:

<p>Microsoft released <b>Visio for Enterprise Architects</b> (VEA) as a download to MSDN Universal subscribers in mid-January 2002 as part of <b>Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect</b> (VSEA). VSEA was generally released in CD and DVD format mid-February 2002 (see <a href = "http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/prodinfo/purchase/pricing.asp">VS .NET pricing details at MSDN)</a>. Visio for Enterprise Architects includes Visio Professional 2002 as well as enhanced versions of the database and software modeling solutions formerly in Visio Enterprise 2000: its database modeling solution provides deep support for ORM and logical/physical database modeling. 

<p><i>The latest release of Microsoft Visio for Enterprise Architects shipped on 2003, April 24, as part of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 Enterprise Architect edition.</i>

<p>Scot Becker of Orthogonal Software has released <a href = "http://www.orthogonalsoftware.com/products.html">Orthogonal Toolbox</a>, a free add-on to Visio for Enterprise Architects that exposes most of the model details stored in an ORM source model or a logical database model as an XML layer. 

<p>The former ORM tool known as <i>VisioModeler</i> is freely available as an unsupported product from Microsoft Corporation (as a 25 MB download). Models developed in VisioModeler may be exported to Microsoft's current and future ORM solutions, which are based on the Visio drawing engine. To obtain the free VisioModeler download titled "VisioModeler (Unsupported Product Edition)", click on this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=27489">download page</a>, and click on the file MSVM31.exe to download it. The 25 MB file takes just over 2 hours to download on a 28.8 k modem. 

<p><b>Books</b>:
<br>The following book is available: Halpin, T.A. 2001, <i>Information Modeling and Relational Databases</i>, published by <a href="http://www.mkp.com">Morgan Kaufmann Publishers</a> (ISBN 1-55860-672-6). Details on this book may be found at the <a href="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/catalog.asp?ISBN=1-55860-672-6">book's website</a>. The book can be ordered online at the publisher's website (above) or at various other sites, for example at <a href = "http://btobshop.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?userid=68W63957LO&mscssid=PGUFW4HF4C4C9LKE9P65NWSV1QNH72A5&btob=Y&isbn=1558606726">Barnes&Noble</a> or at <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558606726/o/qid%3D987864198/sr%3D2-1/002-1938724-2527255">Amazon</a>. <br><br>

	<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><IMG SRC="images/home_pic.gif" WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="130" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Home Picture">Object Role Modeling (ORM) is a powerful method for designing and querying database models at the conceptual level, where the application is described in terms easily understood by non-technical users. In practice, ORM data models often capture more business rules, and are easier to validate and evolve than data models in other approaches. 
	<P>This site features a number of technical papers and articles on ORM, as well as other approaches such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Permission has been obtained from the relevant publishers to reproduce these publications on this website, and to make them freely downloadable. If you are unfamiliar with ORM, you may want to first review the <A HREF="overview.html">ORM in Detail</A> section of this site. Details about upcoming courses and conferences, as well as links to websites with additional ORM publications may be found in the <a href = "resources.html">Resources</a> section.
