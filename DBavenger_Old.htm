<font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><i>&quot;There's so much bad database design in the world,&quot; Dr. Terry 
Halpin says in his soft Australian drawl. &quot;The problem is that the people 
who understand what the database needs to do are businesspeople, 
and the people who actually build the system are techies. There's often 
a communication breakdown, and what results are systems that 
don't work as well as they could.&quot;</td></tr></table>

<img src="images/film_strip.jpg" width="96" height="356" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="">
Halpin's mission is to eradicate bad database design, and his method is to 
lift information modeling to a level that is truly conceptual, yet retains  the rigor 
of formal logic. Halpin, Visio Director of Database Strategy, brings more 
than three decades of academic and industry experience to this role. With 
degrees in physics, mathematics, education, and philosophy&#151;not to mention a Ph.D. 
in computer science&#151;he's found a way for his interest in logic to span 
several disciplines. But since encountering conceptual data modeling for the first 
time in the early 1980s, he's become an evangelist. 
<P>As far as Halpin is concerned, the high-level conceptual modeling 
supported by Object Role Modeling (ORM) is the answer to communication 
breakdowns. &quot;ORM makes it possible for businesspeople and database designers to 
literally speak the same language, so validating a database design is much 
more straightforward. With ORM, formal logic is accessible to businesspeople, 
and they're protected by the strength of it.&quot; Visio 2000 Enterprise Edition 
introduces support for ORM in the context of a powerful suite of IT design tools. 
With Enterprise Edition, implementing conceptual models created in ORM as 
relational or object-relational database schemas is straightforward.

<br><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="6" height="6" border="0" alt=""><br>

In the early '80s, Halpin was introduced to the 
Natural language Information Analysis Method (NIAM), an 
early ORM variation, at the University of Queensland 
in Australia. &quot;It all made sense,&quot; he says, 
remembering that moment of illumination. Within a year, he 
was teaching university courses in conceptual 
modeling and had switched the topic of his Ph.D. thesis 
from proving theorems automatically to formalizing the 
ORM method. As part of his thesis, Halpin worked on 
proving schema equivalence. &quot;Two people might model 
the same domain in different ways,&quot; he explains. &quot;How 
do you know that they're describing the same thing? 
I was interested in developing an approach that 
could formally prove whether two different models 
were equivalent.&quot; In 1989, Halpin and co-author Dr. 
Shir Nijssen, another leading ORM expert, published 
the groundbreaking book<I> Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design.</I>
<img src="images/film_strip_1.jpg" width="96" height="499" hspace="8" vspace="10" border="0" align="left" alt=""><P>In 1995, Halpin left his teaching post at the University 
of Queensland to work full-time in the commercial software industry, where his focus has been 
on developing database design tools. He's found 
the change invigorating. &quot;I'm still involved in a number 
of academic committees, so I stay up-to-date on 
state-of-the-art research. And while I miss teaching, I 
don't miss marking exam papers and assignments. I 
reached a point in my academic career where I didn't want 
to invest energy in research unless it had obvious practical value. It's motivating to work in an 
industry where you can see the immediate use of 
your research.&quot;

<br><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="6" height="6" border="0" alt=""><br>
At Visio Corp. these days, Halpin is researching 
ways that ORM can be used to create conceptual models 
of complex object-oriented software design projects. 
&quot;As the Unified Modeling Language, or UML, 
gains popularity, the higher-level 
conceptual-analysis approach of ORM can help software designers 
capture and validate the business rules relevant to 
their application in much the same way it's helpful 
to database designers.&quot;
<P>The geographic change has been a welcome one, 
too. &quot;I really love the environment here in Seattle,&quot; 
Halpin says. &quot;It's gorgeous. And the people are even 
more polite than they are in Oz. Sometimes I miss the 
beaches at home&#151;it's much too cold to go body-surfing 
here&#151;but I also love trekking in the mountain forests.&quot; 
In addition to his academic credentials, Halpin holds 
a black belt in judo and a blue belt in karate. Like 
many other Seattleites, he cultivates an interest in 
gardening and reads widely, tackling everything from 
science fiction to philosophy texts. And with grown 
children still living in Australia, he and his wife, Norma, 
travel Down Under regularly.
