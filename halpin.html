<p>Dr. Terry Halpin is internationally recognized as the leading authority on Object-Role Modeling (ORM). His academic career included senior lecturer and professor positions in Australia, as well as professorships in computer science at universities in the USA and Malaysia. His industry experience includes several years in data modeling technology at various companies including Microsoft Corporation. He later worked as a research scientist at LogicBlox, and as a data modeling consultant for the European Space Agency. His research focuses on conceptual modeling and conceptual query technology. 

<p> Dr. Halpin is the recipient of the <a href = "http://www.dama.org">DAMA</a> International Academic Achievement Award (2003) and the IFIP Outstanding Service Award (2006).


<p>He is a member of <a href = "http://home.dei.polimi.it/pernici/ifip81/">IFIP WG 8.1</a> (Design and Evaluation of Information Systems), is an editor or reviewer for several academic journals and international program committees, has co-chaired several international workshops on modeling, and has presented at dozens of international conferences in both industry and academia. For many years, his research has focused on conceptual modeling and conceptual query technology for information systems, using a business rules approach. His doctoral thesis formalized Object-Role Modeling (ORM/NIAM), and his publications include over 200 technical papers, and ten books, including <i>Information Modeling and Relational Databases</i>.

	<P>For many developers, entity-relationship (ER) modeling and relational database design go hand in hand. But a growing number of designers have found database design nirvana using another methodology known as Object Role Modeling (ORM). ORM uses English sentences to express how objects relate to one another, and what constraints and business rules apply to these relationships. While based on techniques dating back to the early 1970s, ORM gained popularity with the February 1994 release of InfoModeler, by Asymetrix Corp. (Bellevue, Wash.).
