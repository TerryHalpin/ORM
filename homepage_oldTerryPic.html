      width=254 align=right vspace=5 border=0><B>Object Role Modeling (ORM)</B> is a 
      powerful method for designing and querying database models at the 
      conceptual level, where the application is described in terms easily 
      understood by non-technical users. In practice, ORM data models often 
      capture more business rules, and are easier to validate and evolve than 
      data models in other approaches. 
      <P>This site features a number of technical papers and articles on ORM, as 
      well as other approaches such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

      <A name="new"><B>What's new?</B></A>
      <P><B>NORMA</B> (Neumont ORM Architect) is a new modeling tool under 
      development that supports the next generation of ORM (ORM 2). Implemented 
      as an open-source plug-in to Microsoft's Visual Studio.NET 2005, NORMA 
      requires at least the standard version of Visual Studio 2005. For further 
      details on the ORM 2 graphical notation, see <A 
      href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport1.pdf" target="_blank">ORM 2 Technical Report 
      1</A>. A <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/orm" target="_top">technical preview 
      of NORMA</A> is available on SourceForge. The software is currently in the 
      pre-beta stage, but extensive functionality enhancements and 
      user-interface improvements are planned for the near future. Currently the 
      tool supports entry of ORM2 schemas, verbalization of of most constraints, 
      and code generation (for basic constraints) to a variety of DBMSs 
      (including SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, and PostgreSQL) as well as class 
      models and XML schema. NORMA is capable of importing ORM schemas entered 
      in Visio for Enterpise Architects, but the diagrams need to be laid out 
      manually.  For Part 1 of the specification for automated verbalization in NORMA, see  <A 
      href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport2.pdf" target="_blank">ORM 2 Technical Report 2</A>.  
      <P>An international workshop on ORM will be held in Montpellier, France on 
      November 2-3, 2006, in conjunction with the <A 
      href="http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/index.html" target="_top">On The Move federated 
      conferences</A>. For further details, see the <A 
      href="ORM_2006_CFP.mht" target="_top">ORM2006 Workshop Call For 
      Papers</A>. 
      <P>Added paper on Business Rule Modality (Modeling Issues page).
      <P>Added link to second NORMA Technical report (this page). 
      <P>Added links to ORM 2 drawing stencil for Visio and a bitmap copy of my 
      1989 PhD thesis (Resources page). 
      <P>Added Parts 12 and 13 of Business Rules Journal series on verbalizing 
      business rules (Resources page). 
      <P>Updated conference details and book errata (Resources page). 
      <P>Added paper on Objectification (Modeling Issues page) -- minor updates 
      made. 
      <P>Added article on information modeling and higher-order types (Modeling 
      Issues page). 
      <P>Added article discussing uniqueness constraints on objectifed 
      associations (Modeling Issues page). 
      <P>A webcast on ORM's fact-based modeling approach to database design is 
      available (Resources page). 
      <P>The <A 
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode025/default.asp" target="_top">25th 
      episode of the .NET Show</A> focused on ORM, including an interview with 
      Terry Halpin, Pat Hallock and Dick Barden, and demonstrations of the ORM 
      and database modeling features of Microsoft Visio for Enterprise 
      Architects. 
      <P><A name="software"><B>Software releases</B></A>: 
      <P>See above for details on <B>NORMA</B>. 
      <P>Microsoft's 2005 release of <B>Visio for Enterprise Architects</B> 
      (VEA) includes some minor upgrades of the ORM and logical database 
      modeling solutions (e.g. a driver for SQL Server 2005 is now included). 
      Visio for Enterprise Architects appears to be included in MSDN Premium 
      subscriptions. The least expensive way to get an MSDN Premium subscription 
      appears to be through a purchase of "Visual Studio 2005 Professional 
      Edition with MSDN Premium Subscription." Click here for <A 
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/subscriptions/chart/" target="_blank">MSDN

      <P>Scot Becker of Orthogonal Software has released <A 
      href="http://www.orthogonalsoftware.com/products.html" target="_top">Orthogonal 
      Toolbox</A>, a free add-on to Visio for Enterprise Architects that exposes 
      most of the model details stored in an ORM source model or a logical 
      database model as an XML layer. The original version 1.0 provides the 
      following features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>XML export of the majority of the meta-model information contained 
        in the ORM Source Diagram 
        <LI>XML export of much of the meta-model information contained in the 
        Database Model and ER Source Model Diagrams 
        <LI>User selection of an XSLT style sheet to apply to the XML export 
        <LI>User selection of model element types to be exported 
        <LI>Full integration with Microsoft Visio 2002 for Enterprise Architects 
        and Microsoft Visio 2002/2003 Professional 
        <LI>Corresponding XML schema definition 
        <LI>Sample XSLT style sheet for formatting XML results as an HTML report 
        </LI></UL>
      <P>The version 1.5 upgrade adds the following enhancements and features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Bulk import of fact types into ORM Source Models 
        <LI>Model element browser that displays element properties and can 
        delete most model elements 
        <LI>Model selector to limit the open models you wish to export 
        from/import into/browse 
        <LI>Sample XSLT for generating a XML schema (XSD) from a Database Model 
        Diagram 
        <LI>Full integration with Microsoft Visio 2002/2003 Professional 
        <LI>Various UI/XML schema enhancements </LI></UL>
      <P>Scot also has an informative blog site <A 
      href="http://www.objectrolemodeling.com/" target="_top">ObjectRoleModeling.com</A> that 
      includes lots of useful tips and news about ORM and related database 
      modeling topics. 
      <P>The former ORM tool known as <I>VisioModeler</I> is freely available as 
      an unsupported product from Microsoft Corporation (as a 25 MB download). 
      Models developed in VisioModeler may be exported to Microsoft's current 
      and future ORM solutions, which are based on the Visio drawing engine. To 
      obtain the free VisioModeler download titled "VisioModeler (Unsupported 
      Product Edition)", click on this <A 
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=27489" target="_blank">download 
      page</A>, and click on the file MSVM31.exe to download it. The 25 MB file 
      takes just over 2 hours to download on a 28.8 k modem. 
      <P>A new freeware ORM tool (<I>Infagon</I>) is available -- see Resources 
      page.
