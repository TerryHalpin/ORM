      episode of the .NET Show</a> focused on ORM, including an interview with

<p><b>(1) NORMA</b> (Natural ORM Architect) is a new modeling tool under 
      development that supports the next generation of ORM (ORM 2). Implemented 
      as an open-source plug-in to Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET, NORMA 
      requires at least the standard version of Visual Studio (2005 or 2008). For further 
      details on the ORM 2 graphical notation, see <a 
      href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport1.pdf" target=_blank>ORM 2 Technical Report 
      1</a>. A technical preview of NORMA is available on <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/Default.aspx">The ORM Foundation</a> as well as SourceForge. A series of laboratory tutorials on NORMA are also downloadable as Microsoft Powerpoint files from the ORM Foundation library. Here is an <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/files/">ORM Foundation link to NORMA</a>, and here is a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/orm" target="_top">SourceForge link to NORMA</a>. 
<br>The NORMA software is currently in the pre-beta stage, but extensive functionality enhancements and 
      user-interface improvements are planned for the near future. Currently the 
      tool supports entry of ORM2 schemas, verbalization of of most constraints, 
      and code generation (for basic constraints) to a variety of DBMSs 
      (including SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL) as well as class 
      models and XML schema. NORMA is capable of importing ORM schemas entered 
      in Visio for Enterpise Architects, but the diagrams need to be laid out 
      manually.

<p><b>(2) ORM2_Draw Visio stencil and template</b> for drawing ORM 2 schemas. These files are accessible from the <a       
      href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/files/folders/visio_stencils/default.aspx" 
     >ORM Foundation Library</a>. The stencil has recently been significantly upgraded by Andy Carver. See the ReadMe file for instructions. This stencil requires Visio standard edition (or higher), and is for drawing only, not code generation. It is completely separate from the NORMA tool. 

      <p><b>(3)</b> Microsoft includes a powerful ORM and logical database 
      modeling solution within its <b>Visio for Enterprise Architects</b> (VEA) 
      product. The 2005 release of of VEA includes some minor upgrades (e.g. a 
      driver for SQL Server 2005 is now included). Visio for Enterprise 
      Architects appears to be included in MSDN Premium subscriptions. The least 
      expensive way to get an MSDN Premium subscription appears to be through a 
      purchase of "Visual Studio Professional Edition with MSDN Premium 
      Subscription." Click here for <a 
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/subscriptions/chart/" target="_blank">MSDN 
      subscription information</a> and <a 
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/howtobuy/default.aspx" target="_blank">purchase 
      details</a>. 
      <p>Details on a COM API to the database modeling engine for this tool are 
      accessible at websites maintained by John Miller (see below), and a free 
      add-on that uses this API to expose data model details in the form of an 
      XML document has been released by Scot Becker (see below). 
      <p>The first eight of a series of articles on how to use the database 
      modeling solution within Visio for Enterprise Architects were first 
      published in the Journal of Conceptual Modeling (see InConcept entry 
      below). Here are slightly revised versions of these articles:

      Emphasis is placed on the conceptual model using Object Role Modeling 
      (ORM). This higher level design is more suitable for review with customers 
      while the logical and physical models, derived from the conceptual model, 
      are more suited to the technical staff. Modeling a database at the

<p><b><font size="+1">Professor Sjir Nijssen</font></b> 
      <p>Professor Sjir Nijssen is one of the original pioneers of fact-oriented modeling, and in particular the NIAM, and later CogNIAM, versions of this approach. He has been active in conceptual modeling since the mid-1970s,when he led a group of researchers at Control Data in Belgium to develop fact-oriented technology, and has wide experience in both industry and academia. Sjir's major contributions to fact-orientation include introducing the circle-box notation for object types and roles, and adding a linguistic orientation and design procedure for specifying conceptual schemas. He is currently Chief Technical Officer for <a href="http://www.pna-group.com" target="_top">PNA Group</a>, a consultancy company based in The Netherlands. 
      

<p><b><font size="+1">Professor Robert Meersman</font></b> 
      <p>Professor Robert Meersman is one of the original ORM pioneers, 
      introducing subtyping to the methodology when it was first developed in 
      the Control Data research institute at the Free University of Brussels 
      (VUB). He has been an active researcher in information system semantics 
      and conceptual query technology ever since, and is currently exploring the 
      use of ORM as an ontological basis for the semantic web. He is currently a 
      professor in the department of computer science at the Free University of 
      Brussels, and is the director of its STARlab research laboratory. His <a 
      href="http://www.starlab.vub.ac.be/staff/Robert/" target="_top">home page</a> 
      includes teaching and research information.

His theoretical and industrial research covers many information systems topics, including schema evolution, schema 
      optimization and conceptual query technology. His website includes an 
      extensive list of downloadable research publications, many of them 
      directly related to ORM.
