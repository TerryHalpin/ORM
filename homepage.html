In practice, ORM data models often capture more business rules, and are easier to validate and evolve than data models in other approaches. </font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana">This site features a number of technical papers and articles on ORM, as well as other approaches such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Permission has been obtained from the relevant publishers to reproduce these publications on this website, and to make them freely downloadable. If you are unfamiliar with ORM, you may want to first review the <a href="overview.html">ORM in Detail</a> section of this site. Details about upcoming courses and conferences, as well as links to websites with additional ORM publications may be found in the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> section. </font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana"><b>The editor</b> </font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="halpin.html" target="_blank">Dr Terry Halpin</a> is the leading authority on Object-Role Modeling (ORM). His academic career included senior lecturer and professor positions in Australia, and professorships in computer science at universities in the USA and Malaysia. His industry experience includes many years in data modeling technology at various companies including Microsoft Corporation. He later worked as a research scientist at LogicBlox, and as a data modeling consultant for the European Space Agency. His research focuses on conceptual modeling and conceptual query technology. Dr Halpin formalized the Object Role Modeling approach and has authored ten books and over 200 technical papers.

			<p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><b>NORMA</b> (Natural ORM Architect) is an modeling tool under development that supports the next generation of ORM (ORM 2). Implemented as an open-source plug-in to Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio .NET, NORMA requires either the free Community Edition of Visual Studio (2017, 2019 or 2022) or at least the standard version of Visual Studio (2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 or 2022). For further details on the ORM 2 graphical notation, see <a href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport1.pdf" target="_blank">ORM 2 Technical Report 1</a>. A technical preview of NORMA is available on <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/Default.aspx">The ORM Foundation</a> as well as SourceForge. Here is an <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/files/">ORM Foundation link to NORMA</a>, and here is a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/orm" target="_top">SourceForge link to NORMA</a>.<br />
			Currently the NORMA software tool supports entry of ORM2 schemas, verbalization of of most constraints, and code generation (for basic constraints) to a variety of DBMSs (including SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL) as well as class models and XML schema. NORMA is capable of importing ORM schemas entered in Visio for Enterpise Architects, but the diagrams need to be laid out manually. For Part 1 of the specification for automated verbalization in NORMA, see <a href="pdf/ORM2_TechReport2.pdf" target="_blank">ORM 2 Technical Report 2</a>. </font></font></p>
