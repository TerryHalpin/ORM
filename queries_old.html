      <P>These papers describe the fundamentals of building conceptual queries 
      within the ORM context. ConQuer, the language on which these queries are 
      based, makes query building easy for end users and database 
      administrators.

      <P>Formulating non-trivial queries in relational languages such as SQL or 
      QBE can prove daunting to end users. ConQuer, a new conceptual query 
      language based on Object Role Modeling (ORM), enables users to pose 
      complex queries in a readily understandable way, without needing to know 
      how the information is stored in the underlying database. This article 
      highlights the advantages of conceptual query languages such as ConQuer 
      over traditional query languages for specifying queries and business 
      rules.

      <P>Relational query languages such as SQL and QBE are less than ideal for 
      end user queries since they require users to work explicitly with 
      structures at the relational level, rather than at the conceptual level 
      where they naturally communicate. ConQuer is a new conceptual query 
      language that allows users to formulate queries naturally in terms of 
      elementary relationships, and operators such as "and", "not" and "maybe", 
      thus avoiding the need to deal explicitly with implementation details such 
      as relational tables, null values, and outer joins. While most conceptual 
      query languages are based on the entity relationship approach, ConQuer is 
      based on Object Role Modeling (ORM), which exposes semantic domains as 
      conceptual object types, thus allowing queries to be formulated in terms 
      of paths through the information space. This paper provides an overview of 
      the ConQuer language.

      <P>Formulating non-trivial queries in relational languages such as SQL and 
      QBE can prove daunting to end users. ConQuer is a conceptual query 
      language that allows users to formulate queries naturally in terms of 
      elementary relationships, operators such as "and", "or", "not" and 
      "maybe", contextual for-clauses and object-correlation, thus avoiding the 
      need to deal explicitly with implementation details such as relational 
      tables, null values, outer joins, group-by clauses and correlated 
      subqueries. While most conceptual query languages are based on the entity 
      relationship approach, ConQuer is based on Object Role Modeling (ORM), 
      which exposes semantic domains as conceptual object types, allowing 
      queries to be formulated via paths through the information space. As a 
      result of experience with the first implementation of ConQuer, the 
      language has been substantially revised and extended to become ConQuer–II. 
      ConQuer–II's new features such as arbitrary correlation and subtyping 
      enable it to be used for a wide range of advanced conceptual queries.
